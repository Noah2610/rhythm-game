# Browser Rhythm Game
A simple typescript rhythm game for your browser.

## Running the app
Install dependencies ...
```
yarn install
```

Then you can build the app and run the server with ...
```
yarn start
```
which will serve the app under `http://0.0.0.0:8080` by default.  
Use environment variables `HOSTNAME` and `PORT` to customize.

For development, you can run ...
```
yarn dev
```
to build, run, and rebuild on file changes.
